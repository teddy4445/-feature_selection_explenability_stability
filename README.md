## Usage 

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the '**requirements.txt**' file (pip install requirements.txt)
3. Put the relevant data in the "data" folder.
4. Run the '**meta_data_table_generator.py**' file (python meta_data_table_generator.py or python3 meta_data_table_generator.py)

## Data 
The project structure as a list of **CSV** files taken from open sources (mostly (Kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/]).
The model excepts null rows but they will be removed in the pre-processing stage.
The original data used for the project is located in the "/data/" folder. 

* The authors do not claim any property rights on the data. The data belongs to its owners, and used only for algorithms' measurement.
